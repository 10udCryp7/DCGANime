## Usage
- The project is currently under development, I've just prepared `notebook/ganime.ipynb` for training and `notebook/infer.ipynb` for inference. The easiest way to use them is uploading them to kaggle, loading the data from kaggle and running each cell.

## Results
Result is showed below. The model is trained with 260 epochs. It's clearly seen that the quality of generated images are better over time.
